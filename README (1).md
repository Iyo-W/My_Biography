## Lessons Learned

What I learned and challenges faced:
While building this project, I learned how to better structure a full-stack application and clearly present both personal and technical information in an organized way. I improved my ability to connect front-end components with back-end logic, manage data flow, and think more critically about user experience and clarity.

One of the main challenges was balancing design with functionality—making the project visually clean while still effectively showcasing my work. I also faced challenges in organizing content in a way that was both personal and professional. I overcame these challenges by breaking the project into smaller tasks, iterating on the design, and refining the structure based on feedback and testing. This process helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
